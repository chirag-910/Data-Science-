# To predict the survivor of the Titanic Ship wreck.
Initially started with the Data pre-processing like data cleaning and data wragling.

Once the data pre-procesing is done, featuring Engineering was performed to draw some useful features for developing the model.

After having the cleaned data several Machine Learing Algorithms were trained to predict the survivor and chosing the one which derived the best results
